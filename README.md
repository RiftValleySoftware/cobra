INTRODUCTION
============

COBRA is a security administration toolset for the Rift Valley Platform (RVP).

It is a standalone class that is instantiated with a logged-in CHAMELEON instance. That login needs to be an instance of CO_Login_Manager (or a subclass).

COBRA will allow a manager to create and delete logins, as well as manage security tokens.
